	<h1>About me:</h1>
	<p>I am a junior in the class of 2021 at Cornell University studying Computer Science and Statistics. 
	   My interests in computer science are broadly clustered into programming languages theory and the theory of computation. 
	   In fact, right now, I am working through Sipser's text book on computation theory. In statistics, I am focused in gaining a better understanding of the math behind data science. 
	   Even though my mathematics skills are not strong, I feel it is a good area of focus for me. 
	</p>
	<p>My other pursuits include programming in wide variety of contexts. Previously I focused on making games, building for example
           Settlers of Catan, Chess, Checkers, Mastermind, and even Pong. You can check out Settlers of Catan, Chess and Mastermind on my Github
	   page. Notable, Settlers of Catan was written in OCaml, a move away from Python and Java that I had focused on in the past.
	   After taking functional programming, my view of languages has changed, and I have gained a newfound appreciation for the functional paradigm
	   trying to employ it wherever I go. Especially dear to me is the idea of higher order functions like maps, folds and filters, as well as pattern matching. 
	</p>
	<p>I also have pursued some lower level assembly programming. Pong was written in RISC-V assembly, a very large departure from
	   the programming that I previously did. And I have done some simulation work in hardware, constructing a 5 stage pipelined processor for a core
	   subset of the RISC-V langauge. As a challenge, i also reimplemented the same core subset in OCaml, building an interpreter for the RISC V language. 
	</p>
	<p>At any given time, you might find me working on a project or assignment for class, or relentlesssly studying history for quiz bowl. 
	   And if I have an abundance of free time, I can reliably be found programming something new...
	</p>
