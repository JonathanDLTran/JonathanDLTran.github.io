	<h1>About me:</h1>
	<p>I am a first year MS student at Cornell University studying Computer Science. 
	   My interests in computer science are in programming languages. I want to help develop language based approaches to help programmers write correct code; for example, by developing type systems to rule out errors. I also am interested in developing optimizations to generate faster code. 
	</p>
	<p>Currently, I am working on a compiler for a custom language that target RISC-V assembly. I have been implementing various optimizations 
		in the intermediate representation of the language. 
	</p>
	<p>My other pursuits include programming in wide variety of contexts. Previously I focused on making games, building for example
           Settlers of Catan, Chess, Checkers, Mastermind, and even Pong. You can check out Settlers of Catan, Chess and Mastermind on my Github
	   page. Notably, Settlers of Catan was written in OCaml, a departure from programming in Python and Java.
	   After taking functional programming, my view of languages has changed, and I have gained a newfound appreciation for the functional paradigm
	   trying to employ it wherever I go. I enjoy using higher order functions like maps, folds and filters, as well as pattern matching. 
	</p>
	<p>I also have pursued some lower level assembly programming. Pong was written in RISC-V assembly, a very large departure from
	   the programming that I previously did. I also played around with simulating a processor for the RISC-V assembly, constructing a 5 stage pipelined processor for a core
	   subset of the RISC-V langauge, using the Logisim tool. As a challenge, i also reimplemented the same core subset in OCaml, building an interpreter for the RISC V language. 
	</p>
	<p>Finally, I have been teaching myself formal verification, through the Coq Language. I believe it is important to be able to verify the correctness of the code that a programmer writes. 
	</p>
	<p>At any given time, you might find me working on a project or assignment for class, or relentlesssly studying history for quiz bowl. 
	   And if I have an abundance of free time, I can reliably be found programming something new...
