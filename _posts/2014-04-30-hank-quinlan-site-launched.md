Using some help from another online editor, who designed this Hank Quinlin interface, I was able to scrap together this website. I have to say I know nothing about html, css or yml, but it should be fun to learn. For the time being, I will be using this website both as a way to learn more about web technologies and simple web design, by applying myself to learning html and css to make this website more elegant, while also simultaenously using this website as a storage for my cv and resume. As a side benefit, because there is a blog for this website, I will also be trying to jot down my thoughts. Since I have a bit of free timne this week, I will try to document Spring Break before online school begins at Cornell.
